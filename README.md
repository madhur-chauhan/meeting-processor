    "keyDecisions": [
      "Decision 1 with who made it",
      "Decision 2 with who made it"
    ],
    "discussionPoints": [
      "Main topic 1 discussed",
      "Main topic 2 discussed"
    ],
    "nextSteps": [
      "Next step 1 with timeline",
      "Next step 2 with dependencies"
    ],

Focus on extracting comprehensive meeting insights, key decisions, and actionable items. Be specific and provide context for each point.`;
```

**To modify the AI processing:**
1. **Change the prompt text** - Modify the instructions to focus on different aspects
2. **Adjust the JSON structure** - Add/remove fields or change field names
3. **Update the system message** - Change the AI's role or behavior
4. **Modify temperature** - Lower (0.1) for more consistent output, higher (0.7) for more creative responses

**Current AI Configuration:**
- **Model**: GPT-4
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (balanced consistency and creativity)
- **Max Tokens**: 1000
- **System Message**: "You are a professional meeting assistant and CRM specialist. Analyze meeting transcripts to extract actionable items and CRM-relevant information. Detect if meetings are client-facing and extract sales intelligence when applicable. Return data in the exact JSON format requested."

**Example Modifications:**
- **Focus on different meeting types**: Change prompt to emphasize sales meetings, project updates, or strategic planning
- **Add custom fields**: Include budget information, risk assessments, or stakeholder feedback
- **Change output format**: Modify to return different JSON structures or even plain text summaries
- **Adjust AI personality**: Change system message to be more formal, casual, or specialized

**Code Location:**
The AI prompt and configuration are located in the `index.html` file around **line 1538** in the `processTranscriptWithOpenAI()` function. Look for the `const prompt = ` section to modify the instructions.
